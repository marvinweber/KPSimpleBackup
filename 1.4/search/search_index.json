Added Performance Improvements for Long-Term-Backups: Instead of exporting the database for each LTB backup separatly, it is exported once and copied afterwards now. Backups on Close: They will now only be created, if the database has been modified Backups of the KeePass config files now also are created with timestamps and they are cleaned up, similar to normal backups of database files. Fixes Relative backup paths are now relative to the database file, not the KeePass application. Miscellaneous Improved descriptions in the settings. Improved logging. Version 1.3.0 (May 2020) Related issues can be found in the release GitHub milestone . Added Possibility to add \"relative\" backup paths in the advanced settings. Possibility to backup the KeePass configuration ( KeePass.config.xml ). Changed/ Improvements KeePass application window is blocked and greyed out during active backup process. Perfom cleanup based on creation time of files, not based on file name. Existence of backup location is verified and, otherwise, directory is created if possible. Show a warning if the backup finishes with errors by default. Miscellaneous Code cleanup & improvements. Version 1.2.1 (October 2019) Fix : Backups crashed/ weren't performed (due to problem with logger). Version 1.2.0 (October 2019) Added Custom file-endings for backup-files. Long-Term-Backups. New backup-trigger: When the database or the KeePass application is being closed. Basic logging functionality, session log can be viewed via dropdown-menu KPSimpleBackup > Open session log . Changed/ Improvements It's possible now to select any directory as backup-directory, e.g. selecting an smb-share without mouning it as a drive. File-amount to keep (of backup files) can be set up to 10_000. Backup-files have same file-ending as original database (default). Redesigned Settings > Advanced tab to be more clear. Version 1.1.1 (September 2019) Fixes The list-box with the backup paths in the settings is now bigger and has horizontal scrolling enabled. Original database file won't be overwritten when backups are stored in the same directory. Version 1.1.0 (March 2019) Added Auto-Backup of the Database when it's being saved can now be disabled in the advanced settings. Multiple Backup Folders can now be added. Custom format for date/ time for the backup files can now be set, see docs for details. .plgx file is now also provided. Changed Installation : .dll file or .plgx file Version 1.0.0 (March 2019) Added Cleanup: Only keep specified amount of backup files per database. Choose whether to use Database Name or File Name for Backup File Name. Choose whether to move old backups to trash or delete them permanently.

(9) Backup Database on Save : If enabled, a new backup will be performed whenever you save your database (or KeePass does save the database automatically). If disabled, you still can perform backups manually via the \"Tools\" context menu, or via (12). (10) Warnings : If enabled, a popup will be shown if a backup fails for whatever reason. If disabled, you can still see whether backups were sucessfull or not in the info text at the left bottom corner of the KeePass window. (11) Custom File Extension for backup files: you can specify a custom file extension/ending that should always be used for backup files of the database (instead of the original file ending). (12) Backup on close : If enabled, backups will be triggered if the database is closed or locked or if KeePass is exited. A backup will only be performed, if the database has been modified after the last backup. (13) Relative Backup Paths : You can add a relative backup location (relative to the location of the database file!) here.
