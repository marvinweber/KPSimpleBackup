This is a simple KeePass Plugin that saves a backup of your Password-Database to a backup location and keeps a specific amount of the most recent backups - every time you save your database or trigger the backup manually.

**Note: I don't accept responsibility for any data loss!**  
(However, the originial Database File should not be touched by this plugin. To prevent data loss don't disable the usage of the recycle bin!)
