# Installation

## Recommended: Option 1 - via `.plgx`-file
Extract the zip-Archive - downloaded from the [Release-Page](https://github.com/marvinweber/KPSimpleBackup/releases/latest) - open the `plgx` folder and copy the `KPSimpleBackup.plgx` file into the `Plugins` folder of your KeePass installation. This also works with the portable version of KeePass.

## Option 2 - via `.dll`-files
Extract the zip-Archive - downloaded from the [Release-Page](https://github.com/marvinweber/KPSimpleBackup/releases/latest) - open the `dll` folder and copy both, the `KPSimpleBackup.dll` **and** the `Ookii.Dialogs.WinForms.dll` file into the `Plugins` folder of your KeePass installation. This also works with the portable version of KeePass.

ℹ️ It is also possible to copy all three files into the Plugins folder and KeePass will decide by itself which of them it should use.
